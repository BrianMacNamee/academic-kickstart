# Biography

Dr. Brian Mac Namee received a BA (mod) and PhD in Computer Science from Trinity College Dublin in 2000 and 2004 respectively. After a period working in industry as an R & D software engineer for Agilent Technologies, Brian joined the School of Computing at Dublin Institute of Technology as a lecturer in 2005. At DIT Brian co-founded the Applied Intelligence Researcher Centre (www.ditairc.ie), and developed DIT's successful MSc in Computing (Data Analytics) programme. In 2015 Brian joined the UCD School of Computer Science as a lecturer where he is a Principal Investigator at the CeADAR centre (www.ceadar.ie) and a Funded Investigator at the Insight centre (www.insight-centre.org). Brian's research focuses on machine learning, predictive analytics, data visualisation, and augmented reality. Brian has published extensively in machine learning, predictive analytics, and information visualisation - a recent highlight is the textbook "Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics: Algorithms, Worked Examples and Case Studies" published with MIT Press in 2015 (www.machinelearningbook.com).
